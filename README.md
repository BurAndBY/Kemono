[Kemono](https://kemono.party) is an open-source reimplementation of [yiff.party](https://yiff.party/). It archives and dumps data, images, and files from paysites like Patreon.

Kemono's codebase consists of both importers to handle API data and a frontend to share it. While the status of the project is considered stable, there may be bugs and weird quirks here and there. Beware!
